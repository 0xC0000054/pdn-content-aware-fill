# pdn-content-aware-fill

A [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net) Effect plugin that replaces the contents of the selection with pixels that are the closest match to the areas outside the selection.   
This is often called 'content aware fill'.   

This plugin is based on the GIMP [Resynthesizer](https://github.com/bootchk/resynthesizer) plugin.  
Some icons are from or based on those in the [Fugue](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) icon set by Yusuke Kamiyamane.


##  How to install the plugin

1. Exit Paint.NET.
2. Place ContentAwareFill.dll in the Paint.NET Effects folder which is usually located in one the following locations depending on the Paint.NET version you have installed.

  Paint.NET Version |  Effects Folder Location

  Microsoft Store | My Documents\paint.net App Files\Effects

3. Restart Paint.NET.
4. The plug-in will now be available as the Content Aware Fill menu item in the Photo category of the Paint.NET Effects menu.
